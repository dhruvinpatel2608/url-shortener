###  🧠  How It Works

1️⃣ The user enters a full URL and an optional custom short code.

2️⃣ The server saves the mapping inside data/link.json.

3️⃣ When someone visits that short code, it redirects to the original URL.

4️⃣ The UI dynamically updates and displays all shortened links in real time..
